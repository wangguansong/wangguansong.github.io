    <p id="article_summary">On Nov 25th Fri, the Acer Chromebook R11 from Amazon.cn finally arrived, and I set it up during my weekend overtime. This article is about the process for later reminders and reference to other pathetic Chromebook users in mainland.</p>

  <section>
    <p>I've been set my eyes on the Acer R11 for a long time.</p>
    <p>Since my Toshiba Tablet ($250) suddenly died and my Nook Simple Touch ($25) was lost somewhere, I have been in a void of electronic toys. I carried Acer C720 everyday even though its functionality is cutted by the Wall. I planned to put a large SSD in it while I learned about this one. It can satisfy most of my daily needs: reading pdf files. Furthermore, Google Play can be enabled on this machine, which brings much more ways to enjoy it. And it's in my budget of a tablet/netbook.</p>
    <p>Amazon used to carry only the 2GB memory version until recently it has the 4GB version. The minor price drop finally made me pull the trigger. I placed the order after Double 11. Due to short of stock, it took Amazon several days to ship the order out, and then it got delayed at the Beijing customhouse. As it finally arrived, I set it up during my weekend overtime. And now it replaces C720 as my daily commute companion.</p>
    
    <h3>Openning Case</h3>
    <p>I just bought another Acer laptop (TMP248) for my father not long ago, and I realize the inside packing is similar among Acer products. It contains the machine itself, power cord, and some paperworks. The power cord is in U.S. standard, so you need to prepare an international outlet switch or a power cord of China standard.</p>
    <p>This version has white body. Its size is similar as C720, but it's a little bit thicker probably due to the touchscreen. R11 has a full size SD card slot which can take the whole card, as C720's slot will leave half of the card outside. I feel R11 as the same weight as C720. It is certainly heavier than most of the tablets, while lighter than most of the regular laptops.</p>
    <p>Nam viverra, enim eget semper efficitur, felis tellus convallis orci, quis interdum erat tellus nec leo. In metus mi, fringilla vitae pretium in, fermentum auctor purus. Aliquam blandit imperdiet vehicula. Nam commodo tempus ex vel interdum. Mauris eget nisl pulvinar, venenatis justo eu, iaculis ante. Mauris quis consequat arcu. Donec iaculis sit amet enim quis dictum.
