    I planned to get myself a kindle for my birthday, but what's the point to wait for it? This is the fourth kindle I bought and finally it is for myself. Apparently I have reached a life stage that reading is relaxing to both my eyes and mind.
    </p>
    <p>
    As the new season and book coming soon, I decide to reopen the series of <cite>A Song of Ice and Fire</cite>. I got the kindle on the end of March and now I get to 30% of the first book. I don't know if I can finish all in time before the new book's release.
    </p>
    <p>
    Anyway, knowing plots from later of the timeline gives me a new perspective, which makes rereading quite interesting. Some seemingly trivial dialogues and details become meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here I'm going to keep records of my progress and favorite quotes.
