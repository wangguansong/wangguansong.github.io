    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      As the title suggested, my name is Wang, Guansong and this is my
      site.
      I'm also known as Butters because I use his picture as my icon
      all over the internet.
      Despite what the picture implies, I'm not blonde, short, cute or
      round-faced.
      Although my friends claim I look exactly like Butters.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I'm born and raised in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang">Shenyang</a>,
      the largest city in Northeast China.
      As I was searching for the wikipedia page for Shenyang, I was
      surprised my high school also had one:
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Yucai_School">
        Northeast Yucai School</a>!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then I went to Beijing for college at
      <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>.
      I was enrolled in
      <a href="http://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/index_en.php">Yuanpei</a>
      program (now renamed to college), which confused a lot of people
      who cared to ask about my department.
      Or I could have just answered Economics, since that was my major
      for graduation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Afterwards I studied in the
      <a href="http://www.unc.edu">
        University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>,
      concentrated in financial econometrics.
      For those who don't know, it's statistics or mathematics to be
      used in economics and especially finance.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Basketball is my sport.
      Every tall kid has to be encouraged to play basketball by some
      one at some time growing up.
      After Yao retired I don't really have a home team in NBA.
      However, I do enjoy watching Spurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I run occasionally, mostly to lose weight.
      I don't have runner's high and I hate it most of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not an avid reader, but I do like books.
      I have a Nook Simple Touch, which I paid $30 for at
      Thinksgiving sale. Love it.
      I bought paper books mainly to support the local stores.
      The book stores I frequent in Chapel Hill and Shenyang are all
      occupied by some cats. Coincidence?
      Right now I'm reading <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, and
      <em>The Three-Body Problem</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy watching US TV shows.
      I will not list them so you can judge me watching too much TV.

    <h2>Programming and Data Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      I guess this will be my trade.
      Fortunately I am interested in the subject enough to do them
      sometimes just for fun.
      Half of the purpose of this site is actually as a showcase for
      my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mainly work with Ubuntu 14.04.
      I mess the system around once in a while (most likely 6 months
      for some reason).
      Yeah, geek alert.
      I have 4 or 5 laptops still running well.
      So it was not a good experience upgrading systems back then when
      Ubuntu was not that user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      R is my major working language.
      I began with Matlab and used it for a few years.
      I've heard about R a lot but never really bothered to try until
      I got to do some parallel computing on a remote CLI server.
      The Matlab parallel toolbox requires the GUI to be open so I had
      to keep the login status.
      Maybe there's a way for Matlab to do it, but I'm happy with R now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know C/C++ and that's about it.
      I had classes on them but never had the proper occasion to really
      practice them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python, Shell, SQL, etc, I only learned them just enough to
      accomplish whatever I needed to do.
      So yeah, I'll put all of you in my resume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last thing, I write either plain text or LaTeX.
